Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Overview

This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built in Python using the Pygame library. The visualizer currently supports two popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. It provides a graphical representation of how these algorithms work by animating the sorting process.

Features

Bubble Sort Visualization: Watch the step-by-step progression of the Bubble Sort algorithm in action. Visualize how elements "bubble up" to their correct positions.
Insertion Sort Visualization: Witness the Insertion Sort algorithm in motion. See how elements are sequentially inserted into their proper places.
User Interaction: Pause, resume, and reset the visualization at any point to observe specific steps or restart the sorting process.
Customizable Array Size: Choose the size of the array to be sorted, allowing you to visualize the algorithms with different input sizes.
Prerequisites

Before running the visualizer, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: Download Python
Pygame: Install Pygame using pip install pygame
